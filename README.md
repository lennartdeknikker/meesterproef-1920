# Meesterproef @cmda-minor-web 1920
The [`foxfit_product`](https://github.com/kylebot0/foxfit/tree/b0fd4d8faf68c2ade88c7a7f61595e1f9e82087a) folder contains the final version of our application that functions as a proof of concept for the FoxFit project on visualising data regarding the movement of children with Astma who have been wearing a device that monitors the duration and intensity of their movement over a period of six weeks. 

We worked on this project as part of [the course called "Meesterproef"](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/meesterproef-1920) for [the Web Development minor](https://everythingweb.org/) at the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/). More information on this project and the [Design Rationale](https://github.com/kylebot0/foxfit/wiki) can be found in [the wiki of the original project repository](https://github.com/kylebot0/foxfit/wiki).

#### Live demo
Check out a demo of the actual application [here](https://foxfit.herokuapp.com/).

#### Product biography
As part of the exercise, we also had to write our own product biography. This document is part of [this repository's wiki](https://github.com/lennartdeknikker/meesterproef-1920/wiki).
